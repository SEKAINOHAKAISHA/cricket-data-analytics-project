His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home."

Perhaps the first wicketkeeper-batter in the country good enough to be seen as a long-term successor to Mushfiqur Rahim, he emerged from the northern district of Dinajpur, around 330km from the capital, Dhaka, beginning his adolescent life as a young cricketer at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan and impressing with his heavy run-scoring in schools and age-group cricket. Litton was picked in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2012, the year after he made his first-class debut, and over two U-19 World Cups, that year and in 2014, he cumulatively averaged over 50, with a century and three fifties."

    "description": "Akeal Hosein was handed a chance to impress for West Indies in Bangladesh in early 2021 after several senior players opted out of the tour, but his opportunity had been a long time coming. Primarily a white-ball spinner, Hosein played in the Champions League T20 as a youngster, taking three wickets in as many games for Barbados Tridents. In 2019-20, he proved his red-ball credentials, snaring 36 wickets in the regional four-day competition for Trinidad and Tobago, and chipping in with some useful runs from the lower-middle order."

    "description": "Left-hander Shimron Hetmyer catches the eye as much for his attacking strokeplay as for his hair, coloured various shades of the rainbow. He started out leading West Indies to their first Under-19 World Cup title, in 2015-16, and then made his name as a lower-middle-order bruiser in T20 cricket. In the early 2020s in the IPL, his ability to go from zero to 60 in no time paid dividends for Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals."

    "description": "Tall fast bowler Alzarri Joseph started out as a legspinner in his backyard in Antigua before his height marked him out for a different style of bowling. In his teens he gained a reputation as one of the fastest bowlers on the school circuit, which carried over into the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, where he bowled the competition's fastest delivery, a 147kph zinger that broke Zimbabwe batter Brendan Sly's stumps. Joseph would finish as West Indies' highest wicket-taker of the tournament, with 13 wickets from six games at an economy of 3."

    "description": "Few people in Zimbabwe cricket circles were surprised when Craig Ervine found his way into Zimbabwe colours. A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.But it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his family's living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand."

    "description": "Sean Williams is a bold, dynamic left-hand batsman, and one of the most striking features about his batting is his proficiency at the reverse-sweep. That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016."

But at the other end of that action there have been wickets - and lots of them. A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009."

Chakabva represented Zimbabwe in the Afro-Asia Under-19 Cup in 2005, but despite the rebel crisis and subsequent player drain, had to queue up behind the likes of Tatenda Taibu, Brendan Taylor and Richmond Mutumbami for a place in the senior sides. Though he had a disappointing run during the Pakistan Cricket Academy's visit in 2008, he was included in Zimbabwe's squad for their trip to Canada soon afterwards and made his international debut in a T20I against Pakistan in King City."
